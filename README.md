1. Run "npm install" to install packages
2. Run "npm run dev" to run the frontend
3. Navigate to "http://localhost:5173/" in a browser to see the application
4. Select Take Photo or Upload Photo
5. Click Scan
6. Results will display to user
7. (NOT CURRENTLY WORKING) Click Share to download results
